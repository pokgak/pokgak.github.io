With this information, I was thinking if I could eliminate ingress-nginx and rely on AWS load balancers directly for routing the traffic to our services. AWS load balancer comes in two flavors: the L4 Network Load Balancer (NLB) and the L7 Application Load Balancer. The NLB doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the same feature as ingress-nginx for routing HTTP requests as it operates on the L4 layer only so we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the ALB in this article.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

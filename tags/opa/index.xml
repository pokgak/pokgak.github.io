First, what is the relationship between OPA, Rego, and conftest? Rego is a declarative language used to write OPA policies. Then, OPA is the engine that takes in the policies written in Rego and evaluates it, producing a set of documents called &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo;. You can use OPA and the Rego language directly to write policies for your config files but using conftest will make the DX much better.</description></item></channel></rss>

Terraform modules is a way to bundle a bunch of Terraform resources into one group. Although not explicitly mentioned in the definition, it is also a way to provide an abstraction to the resources inside the module and only expose inputs and outputs that are relevant to the users of the module.
Terraform Module as an Abstraction Layer A Terraform resource usually tends to be generic in that it allows you to configure it multiple ways through the input variables that it can accept.</description></item><item><title>How to use OPA policy from an S3 bucket when using Atlantis policy check</title><link>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/conftest-pull-from-s3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 22:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/conftest-pull-from-s3/</guid><description>Atlantis is an application used for collaborating on a Terraform code base using pull requests and one of the feature that it has is to run conftest and test a set of defined OPA policies. At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article, Atlantis only supports using local sources i.e. local filesystem as the source of the policy. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show an example of how to use an S3 bucket instead as the source for the policies.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with OPA and conftest</title><link>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/opa-conftest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/opa-conftest/</guid><description>I started using OPA at my $dayJob recently and there are some parts that I think is not intuitive to grok for beginners.
If you want to play around with the rules and input, you can use the Rego Playground. It&amp;rsquo;s super useful and I used it to test out policies and test my hypothesis when playing around with Rego language.
How does OPA, Rego, and conftest related to each other?</description></item></channel></rss>

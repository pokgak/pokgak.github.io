I don&amp;rsquo;t have a load-balancer setup in my setup so everytime I want to access a service from laptop, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to run kubectl port-forward. It works but it&amp;rsquo;s annoying.
Usually, in cloud environments like AWS you would setup an ingress-controller that will provision a load balancer for you and use that load balancer to expose your services inside the cluster to the internet using Ingress resources.</description></item></channel></rss>

After reading a bit more on &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/cur-data-transfers-charges.html">how AWS charges for network traffic&lt;/a> you know that this is referring to the cost incurred when your traffic crosses an availability zone (AZ). This article will go through what you can do to eliminate this cross-AZ traffic cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer&lt;/strong>: this is not necessarily the best practice. I try my best to highlight the caveat and tradeoff you&amp;rsquo;re making in this article but please make your own judgement before making the changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring AWS ALB for EKS</title><link>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/exploring-alb-ingress-controller/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 17:07:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/exploring-alb-ingress-controller/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, &lt;a href="https://pokgak.xyz/articles/we-got-ddosed/">my company got DDoS&amp;rsquo;ed&lt;/a> and during the attack I noticed that the first thing that went down is the ingress-nginx pods. With this information, I was thinking if I could eliminate ingress-nginx and rely on AWS load balancers directly for routing the traffic to our services. AWS load balancer comes in two flavors: the L4 Network Load Balancer (NLB) and the L7 Application Load Balancer. The NLB doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the same feature as ingress-nginx for routing HTTP requests as it operates on the L4 layer only so we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the ALB in this article.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

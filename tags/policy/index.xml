At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article, Atlantis only supports using local sources i.e. local filesystem as the source of the policy. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show an example of how to use an S3 bucket instead as the source for the policies.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with OPA and conftest</title><link>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/opa-conftest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 13:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://pokgak.xyz/articles/opa-conftest/</guid><description>I started using OPA at my $dayJob recently and there are some parts that I think is not intuitive to grok for beginners.
If you want to play around with the rules and input, you can use the Rego Playground. It&amp;rsquo;s super useful and I used it to test out policies and test my hypothesis when playing around with Rego language.
How does OPA, Rego, and conftest related to each other?</description></item></channel></rss>

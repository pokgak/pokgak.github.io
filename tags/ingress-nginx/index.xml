In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna describe the steps we&amp;rsquo;ve taken to protect our services from these attacks in the future and also what works and what don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first attack was around 10PM on a Sunday. I was at home at the time and was notified that our ingress-nginx pods were repeatedly crashing. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this happen before and my initial thought was that our service was getting more customers this night so I added more nodes into our cluster and increased the replica count for the ingress-nginx pods. That did nothing. Our pods are still crashing and customers still cannot use our service.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
